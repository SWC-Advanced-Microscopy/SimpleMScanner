[DAQ]

;; The device ID of the NI device that will control the scanning and digital lines
deviceID=Dev1

;; Sample rate of the DAQ board running the scanners and
sampleRate=512000

;; The analog input range over which the DAQ digitizes
AIrange=2

;; The identities of the input channels we will start with
;; For multiple chans do, for example, inputChans=ai0,ai2
inputChans=ai0,ai1

;; The port and line number connected to the shutter (e.g. port0/line1)
shutterLine=port0/line5


;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[shutter]
;; If 1, the shutter is opened when the TTL signal is high
shutterOpenTTLState=1

;; number of seconds to wait after a shutter event before returning control
shutterDelay = 0.1

[waveforms]

;; How many samples to acquire for each pixel. This number of samples are averaged down to one pixel
samplesPerPixel=4

;; We will scan square images of size imSize^2
imSize=256

;; The scan pattern (uni or bidi)
scanPattern=bidi

;; The fill-fraction is used to correct the uni-directional fly-back artifact
fillFraction=0.85

;; peak to peak of the voltage waveform sent to to the galvo control board
scannerAmplitude=2

[image]

;; If true, inverts the acquired data before plotting
invertSignal=false

;; The offset between outgoing and reverse scan lines in bidirectional scanning
bidiPhase=10
